# Defining and using (job) artifacts 

## What is it ? 

```
Jobs can output an archive of files and directories. This output is known as a job artifact.
You can download job artifacts by using the GitLab UI or the API.
```

## Example Walkthrough 

```
# Setup a new repo 
# Setting:
# No deployment planned 
# No SAST 
# Add README.md 

# Using naming convention 
# Name it however you want, but have you tln - nr inside 
# e.g.
# test-artifacts-tln1



```
